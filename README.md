# PDFProj

This is a project I tried out while doing my research before my internship at Desklamp, where I was required to create a PDF viewer app. 
It is based on react-native, and uses a PDF viewer library to open PDFs. The project can be tested by opening the android folder in Android Studio.

This is simply a test project. The final product for the Desklamp app can be found on [m.desklamp.io](m.desklamp.io).
